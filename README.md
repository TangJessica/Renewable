Catalina Energy Capital â€” React (Vite) scaffold
Files:
- package.json
- index.html
- src/main.jsx
- src/App.jsx
- src/index.css
- assets/ (placeholders for logo and team photos)

How to run locally:
1. Unzip the folder.
2. Run `npm install` (or `pnpm`/`yarn`).
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server (Vite).
4. Build with `npm run build`.

Deploy:
- Vercel: Connect the repo and Vercel will detect Vite. Set the root to the project folder if needed.
- GitHub Pages: Build and deploy the `dist/` output or use a static builder.

Notes:
- I matched typography to the live site using Inter (body) and Playfair Display (headings).
- Primary accent color approximated to a deep navy; replace variables in src/index.css to match exact branding.
- Replace images in /assets with your real assets. Filenames used: logo.png, person1.jpg, person2.jpg, person3.jpg
